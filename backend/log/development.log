If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth<br><h6>Why?</h6> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br><h5>Practice respiratory hygiene</h5><br>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.<br><h4>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?</h4><br>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.
